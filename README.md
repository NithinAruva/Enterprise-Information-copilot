# GenAI Enterprise Information Co-Pilot

This project focuses on developing an AI-driven "Enterprise Information Co-Pilot" designed to help organizations seamlessly navigate and interact with their entire information landscape. 
The solution enables easy access to structured, unstructured, and transactional data using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. 
This pipeline leverages advanced techniques for processing and interacting with data, including chunking, embedding, indexing, vectorization, validation, and a reader mechanism, to deliver comprehensive and contextual information retrieval.
